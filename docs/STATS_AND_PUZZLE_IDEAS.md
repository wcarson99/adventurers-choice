## 1. The 5-Stat, 15-Branch Core System

*(This section is a brief reference to the overall framework for context)*

The core character system uses **five specialized stats** (PHY, INS, COM, WIL, FTE), each with **three specialized branches**, resulting in 15 distinct character paths that must all be useful within the puzzle minigame.

| Stat | Core Concept |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PHY** | Physical Action & Efficiency |
| **INS** | Logic, Deduction, & World Knowledge |
| **COM** | Social Influence & Leadership |
| **WIL** | Inner Power & Sustained Effort |
| **FTE** | Luck, Opportunity, & Chaos |

## 2. Puzzle Minigame Styles

The Puzzle Minigame is divided into five distinct styles, each requiring a different primary skillset and encouraging players to select missions based on their character's strengths.

| Style | Description | Primary Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Obstacle Negotiation** | Environmental puzzles involving physical manipulation of the game space. | Moving heavy objects, bypassing physical barriers, or timed traversal. |
| **2. Trap/Treasure Rooms** | Sequential puzzles that test observation, timing, and risk management. | Disabling or bypassing traps to access high-value loot chambers. |
| **3. Decryption Chamber** | Logic puzzles based on ciphers, ancient languages, and complex technical systems. | Solving a complex code, translating runes, or hacking a machine. |
| **4. Social Labyrinth** | Dialogue-driven puzzles requiring social checks against suspicious or hostile NPCs. | Navigating a court, persuading guards, or uncovering a conspiracy via dialogue. |
| **5. Chaos Engine** | Dynamic puzzles with randomized, shifting rules where success relies on chance and quick adaptation. | Managing unpredictable sequences, surviving random environmental shifts, or making high-risk gambles. |

## 3. 5-Stat Integration in Puzzles

The table below details how all five stats and their related branches provide a crucial mechanical function across the five puzzle types, ensuring no specialization is irrelevant.

| Stat | Obstacle Negotiation (PHY Focus) | Trap/Treasure Rooms (INS/FTE Focus) | Decryption Chamber (INS Focus) | Social Labyrinth (COM Focus) | Chaos Engine (FTE Focus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PHY** | **High Impact:** Used for **Might** checks (moving heavy objects) and **Finesse** checks (timed traversal). **Endurance** reduces fatigue penalties. | Used for **Finesse** checks to disarm physical traps or **Endurance** to resist trap damage. | **Low Impact.** | **Low Impact.** | Used for quick-time events triggered by random chaos. |
| **INS** | Used for structural **Analysis** to find weak points in barriers. | **High Impact:** **Engineering** is required to disarm complex mechanical traps. **Analysis** reveals trap patterns. | **Core Stat:** **Lore** for translation, **Analysis** for ciphers, granting hints and extending time limits. | **Medium Impact:** Used to **Analyze** body language and detect NPC deception/lies. | **Medium Impact:** Used to quickly process the chaotic, shifting rulesets. |
| **COM** | Used to **Command/Charm** a companion NPC to assist with physical tasks. | Used to **Intimidate** companion NPCs into checking for traps or standing on pressure plates. | **Low Impact.** | **Core Stat:** **Charm** and **Intimidation** unlock unique dialogue paths and determine success checks. **Tactics** for coordinating companions. | **Low Impact.** |
| **WIL** | **Endurance** and **Focus** reduce Stamina cost of physical effort. | **Resilience** protects against mental or magical traps and drains. | **High Impact:** **Channeling/Focus** sustains concentration, resisting sanity/focus drain penalties. | **Resilience** protects the character from being psychologically manipulated or intimidated. | **Medium Impact:** Used to sustain focus during unpredictable, high-pressure timing sequences. |
| **FTE** | Chance for **Discovery** of a hidden pathway or tool. | **High Impact:** **Heresy** is used to safely trigger a trap for quick access. **Discovery** determines quality of treasure found. | Chance for **Discovery** to find a forgotten scroll with the solution. | Chance for **Survival** to overhear a critical piece of information or clue. | **Core Stat:** **Heresy** governs the chance of a positive random outcome. **Survival** prevents catastrophic failure. |

## Next Steps for Resumption

The core systems for **Combat** and **Puzzles** are now defined and balanced.

The next logical step is to tackle the largest and most persistent minigame, which will define the ultimate scope of the player's character:

**Proposed Next Focus:**

* **The Statecraft Minigame:** Detail how the **15 specialized branches** translate into kingdom management, policy decisions, diplomacy, resource collection, and military strategy.
