# Project: D&D Browser Game - Trading Minigame Design

## 1. The Trading Minigame Concept

The Trading Minigame is a comprehensive economic loop divided into two core phases: **Market Analysis** and **Logistics/Travel**. Success is determined by the character's ability to negotiate prices (COM), predict market shifts (INS), transport goods efficiently (PHY), and withstand financial pressure (WIL).

## 2. Market Analysis Phase (In-Town)

This phase focuses on resource exchange, negotiation, and information gathering when the player is in a town or market hub.

| Stat / Branch | Role in Market Analysis (Negotiation & Discovery) | Specific Mechanic / Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **COM (Charm)** | **Core Price Reduction:** Directly reduces the purchase price or increases the selling price via successful persuasion checks. |
| **COM (Intimidation)** | **Price Coercion:** Used to force a heavily favorable price. This is a high-risk check that can result in refusal to deal or notification of guards upon failure. |
| **INS (Analysis)** | **Market Prediction:** Provides highly accurate projections on future price fluctuations and trend analysis, enabling strategic buying/selling/storage. |
| **INS (Lore)** | **Hidden Demand:** Unlocks knowledge of unique, high-value demand in distant, unmapped, or specialized markets, revealing rare, high-profit routes. |
| **WIL (Focus)** | **Mental Acuity:** Reduces the penalty or cost associated with accessing complex market data (e.g., lowers the cost of buying advanced economic reports). |
| **FTE (Discovery)** | **Hidden Deals:** Increases the chance of being offered an unscheduled, limited-quantity deal from a passing merchant at a heavily discounted price. |

## 3. Logistics/Travel Phase (Expedition)

This phase focuses on the movement of goods between markets, where the cost and risk of the journey must be managed against the potential profit.

| Stat / Branch | Role in Logistics (Movement & Risk) | Specific Mechanic / Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PHY (Might)** | **Carrying Capacity:** **Core Trading Stat.** Directly determines the maximum tonnage of goods the caravan can safely carry, impacting max profit per trip. |
| **PHY (Finesse)** | **Route Speed:** Increases the travel speed and efficiency of the caravan on complex terrain, reducing the *time-cost* and risk exposure of the trip. |
| **PHY (Endurance)** | **Fatigue Resistance:** Reduces the chance of caravan breakdown, animal exhaustion, or crew fatigue penalties on long journeys. |
| **INS (Engineering)** | **Transport Automation:** Used to unlock and implement automated transport methods (e.g., building roads, upgrading carts) on a micro-scale for reduced long-term cost. |
| **COM (Tactics)** | **Caravan Defense:** Used to organize the caravan for defense, increasing the success rate of a defensive maneuver during a bandit or monster encounter. |
| **WIL (Resilience)** | **Financial Stability:** **Crucial Role.** Protects against "Market Panic" events (sudden, severe price drops) and increases the duration the character can hold onto inventory without succumbing to storage cost pressure. |
| **WIL (Channeling)** | **Asset Management:** Used to maintain focus during long periods of sustained market investment, such as managing a trading guild's portfolio. |
| **FTE (Heresy)** | **Chaotic Events:** Increases the chance of encountering high-risk travel events—either a massive bandit ambush or a sudden, lucrative, unscheduled trade opportunity. |
| **FTE (Survival)** | **Loss Prevention:** Grants a chance to save a portion of the cargo if the caravan is attacked or suffers a debilitating loss event (e.g., goods survive a river crossing accident). |

## Next Steps for Resumption

With **Combat, Puzzles, Production, and Trading** now fully integrated with the **5-Stat, 15-Branch** system, the only remaining core layer is the persistent macro-game.
