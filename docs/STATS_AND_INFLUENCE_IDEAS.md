# Project: D&D Browser Game - Intrigue & Faction Minigame

## 1. Core Concept: Social Warfare

The **Intrigue & Faction Minigame** replaces macro 'Statecraft' and focuses on non-economic power acquisition, social manipulation, and political warfare. The goal is **Ascendancy**—to gain a pre-determined position of power by accumulating **Influence Points (IP)** and securing the **Loyalty** of critical NPCs and territories.

## 2. Core Mechanics: Faction Board & Currencies

| Currency / Resource | Source | Use in Game |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Influence Points (IP)** | Generated by mission completion, high-level **COM** checks, and spending Gold in the Intrigue Minigame. | Used to perform high-stakes actions like securing an audience with a noble or attempting a high-level espionage mission. |
| **Favors (FVR)** | Generated by successfully securing and maintaining the **Loyalty** of key NPCs and completing high-stakes **COM/WIL** missions. | Used for **Cross-System Utility** (see Section 4). |
| **Loyalty Score** | A persistent score for NPCs/Factions, increased by **COM-Charm** and maintained by **WIL-Channeling**. | High Loyalty generates FVR. Low Loyalty generates IP (via blackmail/intimidation). |

## 3. 5-Stat Integration in Intrigue Actions

| Stat / Branch | Role in Intrigue & Faction Minigame | Specific Mechanic / Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **COM (Charm)** | **Recruitment:** Primary stat for persuading and securing the **Loyalty** of key high-value NPCs and factions. |
| **COM (Intimidation)** | **Coercion & Blackmail:** Primary stat for forcing **Loyalty** or securing valuable IP by threatening rivals (high risk of retaliation). |
| **COM (Tactics)** | **Agent Network:** Increases the size, reliability, and effectiveness of your deployed network of agents and informants. |
| **INS (Analysis)** | **Intel Evaluation:** Used to correctly interpret ambiguous intelligence reports and determine if a source is lying, preventing wasted action. |
| **INS (Lore)** | **Weakness Discovery:** Unlocks deep background knowledge on major NPCs and factions, revealing hidden vulnerabilities to exploit. |
| **INS (Engineering)** | **Technical Espionage:** Used to create listening devices, forge seals/documents, and bypass physical security during covert missions. |
| **WIL (Focus)** | **Resource Efficiency:** Reduces the **Influence Point (IP) Cost** and Gold Cost of all Intrigue actions (e.g., bribing, research, running campaigns). |
| **WIL (Channeling)** | **Sustained Influence:** Used to maintain political **Wards** (counter-rumor campaigns) and ensure the long-term loyalty of converted allies. |
| **WIL (Resilience)** | **Anti-Intrigue Defense:** **Core Defense.** Protects the character from being blackmailed, mentally manipulated, or corrupted by rival agents. |
| **FTE (Heresy)** | **Chaotic Breakthrough:** Triggers random, unpredictable public scandals or events that can be manipulated to either damage a rival or boost your own standing. |
| **FTE (Discovery)** | **Secret Finds:** Increases the chance that your agents will uncover a major, game-changing secret or piece of evidence during a routine mission. |
| **FTE (Survival)** | **Escape Clause:** Grants a small chance to automatically negate the worst effects if a risky Intrigue action (like a coup attempt) fails spectacularly. |
| **PHY (Finesse)** | **Agent Evasion:** Used for covert agent missions, increasing the chance of success for infiltration and escape maneuvers. |
| **PHY (Might)** | **Forced Compliance:** Used to ensure compliance after a blackmail check succeeds or to install a friendly leader after a coup. |
| **PHY (Endurance)** | **Stress Resistance:** Reduces the stress/fatigue penalties incurred by operating within the high-pressure political environment. |

## 4. Cross-System Utility: Spending Favors (FVR)

Favors (FVR) are the primary way the social power gained in this minigame impacts all other systems.

| FVR Use Category | Effect of Calling in a Favor | Primary Stat Synergy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mission Influence** | **Progression Control:** Unlocks missions otherwise restricted by political status. Guarantees specific niche equipment/loot drops or increases XP/Gold rewards. | **COM, FTE** |
| **Combat Utility** | **Reinforcements:** Call in a temporary, high-level NPC ally for a single fight. **Intelligence:** Receive a detailed analysis of a boss's weakness (temp **INS-Analysis** buff). | **COM, INS** |
| **Puzzle Utility** | **Bypass/Cheat:** Gain a high-quality hint, automatically solve one difficult puzzle step, or gain a key to bypass a physical obstacle. | **INS, WIL** |
| **Trading Utility** | **Access & Safety:** Gain temporary access to a "Black Market" trader with unique goods. Negate a single travel risk (e.g., avoid a bandit encounter). | **COM, PHY** |
| **Production Utility** | **Materials & Labor:** Receive a delivery of a rare, high-quality material needed for a key recipe. Eliminate all **Labor Fatigue** penalties for one production turn. | **PHY, WIL** |
| **Personal Defense** | **Intervention:** Automatically negate a rival's critical action against you (e.g., stop a blackmail attempt or an assassination plot). | **WIL, FTE** |
