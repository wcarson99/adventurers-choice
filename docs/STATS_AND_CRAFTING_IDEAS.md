# Project: D&D Browser Game - Core System & Production Minigame

## 1. The 5-Stat, 15-Branch Core System

The game utilizes five specialized stats for character investment, each defining a major archetype and containing three specialized branches.

| Stat | Core Concept | Role in System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Physique (PHY)** | Physical Action & Efficiency | Raw physical ability, speed, and endurance of movement/labor. |
| **2. Insight (INS)** | Logic, Deduction, & World Knowledge | Mental acuity, analysis, and mechanical skill. |
| **3. Command (COM)** | Social Influence & Leadership | Persuasion, motivation, delegation, and tactical oversight. |
| **4. Willpower (WIL)** | Inner Power & Sustained Effort | Mental fortitude, focus, magical resource pool, and resilience. |
| **5. Fortune (FTE)** | Luck, Opportunity, & Chaos | The influence of fate, external randomness, and discovery. |

## 2. The 15 Specialization Branches (5x3 Grid)

These branches are the specialization points players invest in, defining their high-impact abilities across all five minigames.

| Stat | Branch 1 (Focus) | Branch 2 (Control) | Branch 3 (Defense) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PHY** | **Might (STR):** Raw force, Melee Damage. | **Finesse (DEX):** Evasion, Speed, Ranged Damage. | **Endurance:** Stamina regeneration, resistance to movement impairment. |
| **INS** | **Analysis:** Weakness and trend identification. | **Engineering:** Devices, Traps, Technology. | **Lore:** Decryption, language, creature knowledge. |
| **COM** | **Intimidation:** Coercion, threat, single-target debuffs. | **Charm:** Negotiation, group/social persuasion. | **Tactics:** Group buffs, morale, battlefield support. |
| **WIL** | **Focus:** Mana/resource efficiency, cost reduction. | **Channeling:** Sustained spells/wards, resistance to distraction. | **Resilience:** HP, Status Effect Resistance (Mental & Physical). |
| **FTE** | **Discovery:** Loot rarity, resource finding. | **Heresy:** Chaos magic, unpredictable critical strikes. | **Survival:** Divine saves, escaping fatal events. |

## 3. The Production/Crafting Minigame

The **Production/Crafting Minigame** is a resource transformation and efficiency loop, providing a dedicated mission type for the Builder/Crafter archetype.

### A. Three Production Paths

The crafting system is divided into three paths, primarily driven by one of three key stats (PHY, INS, WIL):

| Path | Primary Driver | Focus & Output Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artisan/Refinement** | **PHY (Might/Endurance)** | **Focus:** Physical labor, blacksmithing, farming, quarrying. **Output:** Armor, Weapons, Base Building Materials. |
| **Engineering/Assembly** | **INS (Engineering/Analysis)** | **Focus:** Technical assembly, design, chemistry. **Output:** Gadgets, Automated Turrets, Advanced Siege Weapons. |
| **Alchemical/Warding** | **WIL (Channeling/Focus)** | **Focus:** Magical infusion, brewing, enchanting. **Output:** Potions, Scrolls, Wards, Enchanted Components. |

### B. Full Stat Contribution to Production

All five specialized stats and their branches influence the production minigame across three phases: **Input, Process, and Output Quality/Quantity.**

| Stat / Branch | Production Role & Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PHY (Might)** | **Raw Output:** Increases raw material processing speed and volume. |
| **PHY (Finesse)** | **Precision:** Increases material efficiency (less waste) during delicate production steps. |
| **PHY (Endurance)** | **Sustained Labor:** Reduces **Labor Fatigue** penalties during long production runs, allowing for sustained, high-volume output. |
| **INS (Analysis)** | **Optimization:** Increases the baseline **Quality** of items by providing optimal assembly data. |
| **INS (Engineering)** | **Automation:** Unlocks automated machinery and speeds up research time for complex recipes. |
| **INS (Lore)** | **Discovery:** Used to translate ancient texts to **unlock new, unique crafting recipes/blueprints.** |
| **COM (Intimidation)** | **Forced Output:** Temporarily increases NPC worker speed, but at the risk of sabotage. |
| **COM (Charm)** | **Resource Acquisition:** Increases success when negotiating for rare raw materials from suppliers (Trading link). |
| **COM (Tactics)** | **Logistical Management:** Optimizes the production flow to minimize downtime and increase workshop output quantity. |
| **WIL (Focus)** | **Resource Efficiency:** Reduces the resource cost (mana, reagents) for all magical crafting processes. |
| **WIL (Channeling)** | **Infusion Duration:** Increases the success rate and *duration* of magical infusion and enchanting processes. |
| **WIL (Resilience)** | **Workshop Safety:** Reduces the chance and severity of catastrophic workshop failures (e.g., explosions, meltdowns). |
| **FTE (Discovery)** | **Material Windfalls:** Increases the chance that collected materials contain an *unlisted, rare bonus component.* |
| **FTE (Heresy)** | **Critical Item Chance:** Significantly increases the chance of a **Critical Item** output (a Masterwork with superior stats). |
| **FTE (Survival)** | **Error Recovery:** Grants a small chance to recover all resources if a critical crafting check fails. |

## Next Steps for Resumption

The four major action-oriented minigames (Combat, Puzzles, Production, Expedition/Travel) are now integrated. The final core system to define is the economic and political layer.

**Proposed Next Focus:**

* **The Trading Minigame:** Detail the combined Market Analysis and Logistics/Travel minigame. How do **COM** and **INS** interact with **PHY** and **WIL** to define profit margins, travel risk, and resource exchange?
