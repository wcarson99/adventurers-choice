# Game Development Rules

## Question vs. Implementation Requests

**CRITICAL**: When the user asks a question (especially "is there anything specified for X?", "how does Y work?", "what exists for Z?"), you should:

1. **Answer the question first** - Search the codebase, read documentation, and provide a clear answer
2. **Do NOT immediately start coding** - Only implement if the user explicitly asks you to build/create/implement something
3. **Distinguish between:**
   - **Informational queries**: "Is there X?", "What exists for Y?", "How does Z work?" → Answer only
   - **Implementation requests**: "Create X", "Build Y", "Implement Z", "Add support for..." → Then code

## When to Code

Only start implementing when the user:
- Explicitly asks you to create/build/implement/add something
- Says "let's build X" or "implement Y"
- Confirms they want you to proceed after you've answered their question

## When NOT to Code

Do NOT start coding when the user:
- Asks "is there anything specified for X?"
- Asks "how does Y work?"
- Asks "what exists for Z?"
- Is just gathering information or understanding the current state

## Workflow for Questions

1. **Understand the question** - What information is the user seeking?
2. **Search and read** - Find relevant code, documentation, or specifications
3. **Answer clearly** - Provide a comprehensive answer about what exists, what doesn't, and what's planned
4. **Wait for direction** - Only proceed with implementation if explicitly requested
